# GamesOfLife
This is a project for the Java OOP course at my university [UNIMORE](https://international.unimore.it/).

It's a Javafx Application consisting in two versions of Game of Life.
Both vesions are flexible, you can create your own rules from the GUI.

# Standard Game Of Life (Square cells)

The standard version is Game Of Life with sauare shaped cells.

This application not only implements then Conway's Game Of Life but also all the versions you can imagine.
In fact there is a GUI for creating your own rules, you can choose the neighbours that cell can see and all the threshold that define when a cell relives and when it dies.

# Hexagonal Gamo Of Life (Hexagonal cells)

This is a different version of game of life where the cells are heagons.

By being hexagonal the cell will behave in very different ways.
The only alredy present ruleset is a version of the Conway's Game Of Life translated to hexagons, but as the Standars version you can implement all the rules you want by creating them in the GUI.
