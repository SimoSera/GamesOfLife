# GamesOfLife
This is a project for the Java OOP course at my university [UNIMORE](https://international.unimore.it/).

It's a Javafx Application consisting in two versions of Game of Life.
Both vesions are flexible, you can create your own rules from the GUI.

# Standard Game Of Life (Square cells)

The standard version is Game Of Life with sauare shaped cells.

This application not only implements then Conway's Game Of Life but also all the versions you can imagine.
In fact there is a GUI for creating your own rules, you can choose the neighbours that cell can see and all the threshold that define when a cell relives and when it dies.

This application could support different rules in the same game, like one cell uses the Conway's rules and the other one a custom rule.
This is mot implemented as now becuase the user would have to set not only the live cells but also te dead ones so it would be a long setup, if in the future i can find a way around like randomly choosing the dead ones.

# Hexagonal Game Of Life (Hexagonal cells)

This is a different version of game of life where the cells are heagons.

By being hexagonal the cell will behave in a different way.
The only alredy present ruleset is a version of the Conway's Game Of Life translated to hexagons, but as the Standars version you can implement all the rules you want by creating them in the GUI.
